To get the scripts_FlatAna.py to work, placed the script and the root files inside of a folder labeled dockertest
in powershell, wrote in docker run command to mount C:\Users\Bryn\dockertest to /data so that dockertest would be readable by the docker container
then set display to current ip
after docker container has been set up, run the script with the following command
python [name of script].py --input [name of input file] --output \ [name of new file]
this worked for root files
copy of docker command for future reference.
docker run --rm -it -e DISPLAY=[Input IP here]:0 -v [filepath]:/data -w /data gitlab-registry.cern.ch/scipp/mario-mapyde/delphes:master
